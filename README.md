# ChatApplication
- Application uses socket.io package for two end communication between server and user.
- The application is done using HTML, CSS, javascript & node.js.
- In this repository I have just uploaded socket.io package but during the run time of the code I have installed socket.io, nodemon packages for server to user-end connection and to save the code in server without running the server all time(In index.js).
- I have also included socket.io package in client.js too.
